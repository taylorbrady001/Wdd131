			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>This website will serve as a hub for a world called
                 Valedracia, a richly detailed fantasy world used for 
                 storytelling, games, and creative writing. It will provide
                  visitors with lore, maps, factions, key characters, and history of the world.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>My site is designed for table top game players, authors, and gamers who 
                 are interested in immersive worldbuilding.
                  It caters to mainly my friends and I. It is a universes 
                  and will be used for material in campaigns or inspiration for other things.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I will have a Theme Toggle (Light/Dark Mode): A button 
                in the header will allow users to switch between light
                 and dark display themes. 
                 Dynamically Generated Cards: Sections like "Meet the Gods", etc will load dynamically using JavaScript.
                 Expandable Lore Sections: On the Lore page, clicking on elements like “Languages,” “Creatures,” or “More Lore” will expand or collapse hidden content.
                 Filtered Lore Display:Users will be able to filter the type of lore they see (e.g., just myths or just creatures). 
                Lore Spotlight Carousel (Home Page): A rotating spotlight area on the homepage will automatically or
                 manually cycle through featured lore elements.
                 Responsive Navigation Toggle:For mobile users, a hamburger menu will allow them to open or close the navigation.
